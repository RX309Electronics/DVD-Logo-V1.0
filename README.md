This software is free and unlicensed but i would still like it and it would be kind of you if you put some credit of me the creator When you distribute the software to the internet, like making a video about it. I will be happy when you put either the link to my github or my project in the description or put "Made by: 309Electronics" in the description. I am a teen who likes thinkering and programming and making weird random projects, i aint a coding expert nor are any projects perfect. In programming exerience i am probably still a beginner and use the internet for troubleshooting (stackexchange helps a lot) but i like to create and troubleshoot small purposeless random projects from the top of my mind, i know the code can be improved or optimised but i work hard on some and sometimes it takes a few days so please appriciate my work and credit me. Feel free to edit the files but please do the steps above.

About The Creator 309Electronics: 309Electronics is a 15 year old self educated electronics enthuisiast, thinkerer, engineer, reverse engineer, programmer, repair guy and project creator. I live in the Netherlands in Eindhoven in a small village called 'acht' I am a 4th year havo highschool student, who is the only electronics guy in my whole class. i am pretty proud of my own work and i am not just a person who is good at a specific subject of electronics but at the whole load of them (mentioned earlier) i have a motto with all of my projects 'if it works dont touch it' I have some socials where is often post nothing at all but i am often always bussy, sometimes so bussy i forget school ðŸ˜² and have to make my homework realy late. my most active social is tiktok. i dont realy use instagram or youtube. I am self educated teen because often my school does not realy do anything with electronics and gives boring geography or history, no thanks give me more sceince and physics. i learn from youtube channels like greatscott, electroboom, electronoobs, veritasium, physicsgirl, nilered, brainiac etc. etc. i often dont realy play games (i do have the pc capeable of doing so just) because i am no hardcore gamer and dont like other games then stray and minecraft, indie games, roblox and self made games.
